You don't really need a reminder why because another glance up into the sky shows you that the giant continent crushing meteor has gotten even closer and will probably strike the earth in aproximately 30 minutes. Normally that would be curtains for everything, but you've been informed by your agency that a machine is bringing that thing to earth and that it also has the ability to push it back. You've localized the radiation it gives off to the center of this town in its townhall. You've got a lot of loved ones that you haven't said goodbye to... but if you can turn this machine around... you'll give everyone on the planet their lives back. As you push closer to the middle of this town through a sea of scared people, you steel your emotions, you'll need to think fast and logically if this is going to work.",

You burst through the double doors and look up to see whats going on. As if by magic, the meteor has been stopped and is floating above the earth. Residents who had gone outside to greet their death with dignity wore shocked faces all around. Slowly, the meteor starts to shrink from taking up the entire sky, to occupying a hemisphere, to floating away out into space. You saved the day! You fall to your knees as you sigh in relief. You need a vacation after this one."
